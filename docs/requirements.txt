## Requirements
- wget
- dwdiff https://os.ghalkes.nl/dwdiff.html
- ansi2html

- Python standard libraries:
  - os
  - re
  - glob

# Validation

## Requirements
- R version (specific version not mentioned, but a recent version is implied)
- R packages:
  - stylo (ensure it's installed with `install.packages("stylo")`)
  - knitr (for setting root directory in R Notebook chunks)
  - writexl (for writing data to Excel files)

- Python Libraries:
    - pandas (for data manipulation)
    - matplotlib (for plotting)
    - scikit-learn (for metrics and confusion matrix)
    - seaborn (for setting color palettes)

- Input Data (for the visualisation of the imposters' results):
    - Excel file containing the validation results: ../results/results_imposters_valid_cosine.xlsx (generated by the [`valid_imposters_4grams_char.Rmd`](https://github.com/PaschalisAg/seneca_stylometry/blob/main/validation/validation_imposters/code/valid_imposters_4grams_char.Rmd))

# Analysis

## Requirements

- Python Libraries:
    - os (for directory and file operations)
    - pandas (for data manipulation, though not explicitly used in the given snippet, it may be required for further data operations)

    - sklearn (for text vectorization)
    - matplotlib (for plotting)
    - seaborn (for setting color palettes and plotting)
    - collections.Counter (for counting frequency of elements, though not explicitly used in the given snippet, it may be required for further frequency analysis)
